A two player game that uses the go board, in which you try to get exactly 5 in a row.
This game is known by several names in different countries.  This is a version that uses 
a whole 21 x 21 board that I used to play in China.

This version of the game is made using Java's Standard Draw, with an engine I made based
on 32 x 32 px image tiles.
